                    <hr>
                    <h3>Data and programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        The foundation of my interests in data science and programming can be traced back to my studies in engineering where I used <mark>Pascal</mark> to control robots, <mark>ABAQUS</mark> for FEA and gained a deeper understanding into the maths of modelling and simulation. 
                        During my PhD, I continued to write programs to support my lab work. 
                        For example I created an image analysis software to calculate contact angles on chemically modified surfaces. 
                        This was my first insight into <mark>Object Oriented Programming</mark> using the likes of <mark>Java</mark> and <mark>C++</mark>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While working in industry managing a team of engineers and scientists developing pathology instruments, we needed to process large quantities of time series data being generated in the lab for algorithm development. 
                        As part of this process I shifted the companies' prolific use of <mark>VBA</mark> (Excel) to <mark>MatLAB</mark> by first demonstrating proof of principle in <mark>Octave</mark>. 
                        The next development milestone was when we needed to conduct a formal verification of this pathology instrument. 
                        This required deepening up on my statistics and updating my knowledge to meet compliance to CLSI (<a href="https://clsi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>) standards for FDA submission, while also promoting the use of <mark>R</mark> for all statistical analysis. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on these foundations and experiences, I have continued to develop and apply my analytical and modelling skills in <mark>Python</mark> while developing products for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. 
                        Further example applications of data science and analytics include: 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As an engineer and scientist, I’ve led and managed multiple projects with experience of developing products from concept through to market. 
                        Many of these products have been for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries with a strong focus on injection moulding and sheet metal manufacturing with integrated electronics and software. 
                        Example product areas include: IVDs, drug delivery, optical instruments and bio-processing equipment.  
                        I’m also an experienced project manager having led, implemented and worked within various flavours of Agile and phase-gate development processes.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Ajitsuke Tamago, aka Ramen eggs, are one of my favorite additions to a hearty ramen bowl.
                        The general recipe for Ajitsuke Tamago requires adding an egg to boiling water for 7 minutes and then submerging it in ice cooled water to prevent further cooking.</p>
                    <p>For this investigation a thermal model of the egg was created using finite-differences in <mark>python</mark> and <mark>Jupyter</mark>. 
                        The model allowed custom meshes which defined the egg geometry and varying diffusion coefficients and also dynamically changed the boundary conditions based on defined criteria.</p>
                    <p>The results showed an alignment between the generally cooking method and the hardness of the composite egg parts (white and yolk) based on the temperatures reached.</p>

                    <!-- <h1>Lego database</h1> -->
                    <p>Lego is awesome! So when I discovered there was a data available to construct a database based on all the sets made since 1949, I could not resist having a look. 
                        So, the first step to exploring this data was to build a local database that I could query.</p>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Construction of the database was done in 5 stages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Install <mark>MySQL</mark></li>
                        <li>Wrote <mark>SQL</mark> scripts to create DB and build Schema based on image above</li>
                        <li>Download and <mark>wrangling</mark> of CSV files from <a href="https://rebrickable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebrickable</a> </li>
                        <li>Loaded CSV data into DB with <mark>SQL</mark> scripts</li>
                        <li>Ran checks to ensure all was working</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Fundamentally I did this because I like Lego! But it also provided me with a local DB to explore, test out my analytical skills and indulge my curiosity.
                        It was a great reminded that cleaning up the data is nearly always required and a significant chunk of any analytical analysis. 
                        For example, I assumed (hoped) the data would be in good shape coming from a working system and in the most part it was. 
                        However, the data did not match the schema (v3) any <mark>MySQL</mark> does not like empty cells nor carriage returns which had to be addressed.

                    <p>Lego is an award winning product and has been popular for decades. 
                        Out of intrigue I create a <mark>MySQL</mark> database from <a href="https://rebrickable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebrickable</a> datasets. 
                        This investigation is my exploration into this database.</p>
                    <p>This investigation primarily uses <mark>R</mark> and <mark>SQL</mark> to look at the 273 different colours of bricks, trends identified in the early 2000's when the company announced it's <em>1.9 billion kr</em> deficit and other observations including <em>Fabuland Lime</em> toilets.</p>
