                    <hr>
                    <h3>Data, modelling and understanding the problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        As an engineer and scientist the acquisition, interrogation and communication of data has been an essential part of my successful career. 
                        I have primarily worked in and consulted for companies in the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors solving technical challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Examples of my work include:</i>
                        <br>
                        Leading multiple product <mark>verification</mark> studies and being responsible for the application of <mark>statistical techniques</mark> to meet industrial standards.
                        Within the field of IVD’s, I have guided studies meeting compliance to the <a href="https://clsi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLSI</a> standards resulting in successful FDA submissions.
                        I have also supported clients in the successful verification of devices like in-halers and otoscopes. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <code>Tools used: R, MatLAB, Octave, VBA (Excel)</code>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        Integrating <mark>experimental data</mark> and <mark>math models</mark> to predict future results and optimise performance has been an essential part of understanding the mechanics of devices during their development.
                        For example: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Integrating <mark>numerical methods</mark> to estimate fluidic mechanical systems and exploring scenarios with <mark>Monte Carlo</mark> simulations to investigate pharmaceutical equipment.
                                This was used to refine the requirements of a system while showing the bottle-necks of the manufacturing process so work packages could be focused on addressing critical areas.</li>
                            <li>Providing guidance on <mark>statistical evaluation</mark> methods and <mark>DoE</mark>. 
                                This supporting colleague's evaluated their scientific hypotheses developing processes for manufacture using standard practices and sound techniques.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <code>Tools used: Python, R, Stan</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Developing and <mark>validating physical models</mark> and rigs has always been an active part of my product development. 
                        For example I've simulated the chemical degradation and mass transport in a drug product's primary packaging to support and guide design decisions enhancing shelflife. 
                        Investigations highlighted the primary parameters that needed to be controlled as part of the design and influenced plausible concept solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other models created as part of design concept, feasibility and optimisation include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Modelling <mark>electromagnetic</mark> fields to optimise magnet shield design for IVD product, resulted in geometry that minimised magnetic interference.</li>
                            <li>Simulation of <mark>optical devices</mark> for root cause analysis of production issues with otoscope light guide. Resulting in the successful identification of the design change that caused the issue so it could be amended.</li>
                            <li><mark>FEA</mark> stress-strain analysis on concept devices used to optimise designs and influence material selection.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <div class="code">

                    <h3>Developing devices from concept to market</h3>
                    <p>
                        I’ve led and managed multiple projects through all phases of development <mark>from concept through to launch</mark> resulting in successful products. 
                        Many of these products have been for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries with a strong focus on injection moulding and sheet metal manufacturing with integrated electronics and software. 
                        Example product areas include: IVDs, drug delivery, optical instruments and bio-processing equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While developing various products I've successfully created test systems and rigs to verify and investigate a product’s performance. 
                        These test systems focused on generating quantitative data for example:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creating a performance evaluation rig for disposable IVD cartridges which included fluidic control generating real-time force and distance data with image analysis of fluidic movement. 
                                I successfully wrote the rig control and data acquisition software in Python.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Ajitsuke Tamago, aka Ramen eggs, are one of my favorite additions to a hearty ramen bowl.
                        The general recipe for Ajitsuke Tamago requires adding an egg to boiling water for 7 minutes and then submerging it in ice cooled water to prevent further cooking.</p>
                    <p>For this investigation a thermal model of the egg was created using finite-differences in <mark>python</mark> and <mark>Jupyter</mark>. 
                        The model allowed custom meshes which defined the egg geometry and varying diffusion coefficients and also dynamically changed the boundary conditions based on defined criteria.</p>
                    <p>The results showed an alignment between the generally cooking method and the hardness of the composite egg parts (white and yolk) based on the temperatures reached.</p>

                    <!-- <h1>Lego database</h1> -->
                    <p>Lego is awesome! So when I discovered there was a data available to construct a database based on all the sets made since 1949, I could not resist having a look. 
                        So, the first step to exploring this data was to build a local database that I could query.</p>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Construction of the database was done in 5 stages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Install <mark>MySQL</mark></li>
                        <li>Wrote <mark>SQL</mark> scripts to create DB and build Schema based on image above</li>
                        <li>Download and <mark>wrangling</mark> of CSV files from <a href="https://rebrickable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebrickable</a> </li>
                        <li>Loaded CSV data into DB with <mark>SQL</mark> scripts</li>
                        <li>Ran checks to ensure all was working</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Fundamentally I did this because I like Lego! But it also provided me with a local DB to explore, test out my analytical skills and indulge my curiosity.
                        It was a great reminded that cleaning up the data is nearly always required and a significant chunk of any analytical analysis. 
                        For example, I assumed (hoped) the data would be in good shape coming from a working system and in the most part it was. 
                        However, the data did not match the schema (v3) any <mark>MySQL</mark> does not like empty cells nor carriage returns which had to be addressed.

                    <p>The Global Health Observatory is the World Health Organisation's gateway to share data on global health. 
                        It is structured into categories of indicators (3043 at time of writing) that describe health statistics. 
                        They generally all have dimensions of time and country, some have additional dimensions for example 'Age Group', 'Sex' and 'Severity'.</p>
                    <p>This exploration primarily uses <mark>python</mark> to explore the GHO databases with <mark>GeoPandas</mark> for generating geospatial charts.
                    Example interactive charts were made using <mark>D3</mark> to demonstrate how the WHO data could be visualized.</p>

                        I've been fascinated with control systems having seen a physical implementation of an inverted pendulum at university. 
                        This is my development of a control system for a single and double inverted pendulum using the pendulum simulator that I previously created.

                        This is a simulation of a classic tower defense game where an offensive side has to travel from a starting location to the oppositions base, take resource, and then return the resource to the start location.
                        Once all resource is acquired, the game is won for the offensive side. 
                        However, the defensive side can build turrets to defend their base giving them the option to win by rendering all the offensive side out-of-the game.
